NAME
       ovs-vsctl - utility for querying and configuring ovs-vswitchd

SYNOPSIS
       ovs-vsctl  [options]  -- [options] command [args] [-- [options] command
       [args]]...

DESCRIPTION
       The  ovs-vsctl  program  configures  ovs-vswitchd(8)  by  providing   a
       high-level    interface    to    its   configuration   database.    See
       ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database
       schema.

       ovs-vsctl  connects  to  an ovsdb-server process that maintains an Open
       vSwitch configuration database.  Using this connection, it queries  and
       possibly  applies  changes  to  the database, depending on the supplied
       commands.  Then, if it applied any changes, by default it  waits  until
       ovs-vswitchd  has  finished  reconfiguring itself before it exits.  (If
       you use ovs-vsctl when ovs-vswitchd is not running, use --no-wait.)

       ovs-vsctl can perform any number of commands in a  single  run,  imple‐
       mented as a single atomic transaction against the database.

       The  ovs-vsctl command line begins with global options (see OPTIONS be‐
       low for details).  The global options are followed by one or more  com‐
       mands.   Each  command should begin with -- by itself as a command-line
       argument, to separate it from the following commands.  (The  --  before
       the  first  command  is optional.)  The command itself starts with com‐
       mand-specific options, if any, followed by the command name and any ar‐
       guments.  See EXAMPLES below for syntax examples.
