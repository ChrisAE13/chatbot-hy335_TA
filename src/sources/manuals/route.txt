DESCRIPTION    

       Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables.  Its primary
       use is to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via
       an interface after it has been configured with the ifconfig(8)
       program.

       When the add or del options are used, route modifies the routing
       tables.  Without these options, route displays the current
       contents of the routing tables

The IP/kernel routing table acts as a crucial map, determining how network packets are forwarded between different hosts and networks. By utilizing the route command, Linux administrators and users can establish static routes, enabling precise control over network connectivity and optimizing data transmission.
To add a default gateway.

sudo route add default gw 169.254.0.0

This assigns a gateway address to which all the packets that do not belong to the network are forwarded.

Note: In this case the, we wish to choose 169.254.0.0 as the default gateway. You may choose as per your need.
