NAME    

     ssh — OpenSSH remote login client

DESCRIPTION      

     ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
     for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to
     provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
     over an insecure network.  X11 connections, arbitrary TCP ports and
     UNIX-domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

     ssh connects and logs into the specified destination, which may be
     specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the form
     ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their identity
     to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol for secure remote access and other secure network services over an insecure network. It is widely used by system administrators and developers to securely manage remote servers and perform other network operations. In this article, we'll explore some of the more common SSH commands used on Linux, with examples of their use. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or just starting out with SSH, this article will provide you with invaluable insight into the power and versatility of these essential commands. So, let's dig in and find out the crucial SSH commands that every Linux user should know.

The ssh command is used to securely log into a remote machine and execute commands on that machine. The basic syntax of the command is “ssh user@host”, where user is the username on the remote machine and host is the address or hostname of the remote machine.
